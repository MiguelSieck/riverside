## A Random Forests Tutorial with Examples in R

Hello RiveRside community ;-)

Come join us for another afternoon of networking and sharing (and pizza!), on Wednesday, November 20th at 5pm, at Rivera Library 140. Whether you are new to R or a data scientist, come talk about the basics of R and work through a ggplot tutorial together. This time we have a bigger room, so bring *all* your friends (and please don't forget to register).

As per usual, we will start by learning from two of our fellow R enthusiasts and their 5-min lightning talks. Email us if you are interested in being one of them (riverside@rladies.org). We will then work through a tutorial on the basics of R and ggplot, so please bring your laptop with R and RStudio already installed. In the end, we will have time for folks to ask for feedback on plots and figures, so bring your data/plots/figures/ideas so we can all brainstorm together =)

Once again, big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us!

See you soon,

Teresa, Marilia & Daniela
