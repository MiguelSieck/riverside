## A Random Forests Tutorial with Examples in R

Hello RiveRside community ;-)

Come join us for a virtual evening of networking and learning on Tuesday, June 2nd, 5:15 pm (PST). Please, don't forget to sign up on our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-riverside/events/270746911/) page to get access to the meeting's ID and password.

Whether you are new to R or a data scientist, join us for a Random Forest algorithm tutorial and see how you can apply machine learning in your research.

At the end of the meeting, we will have time to help each other with any R-related questions.

Please have R and RStudio already installed on your computers. Also please install and verify that the package is loaded and working properly by running the first three lines of code in the tutorial [here](https://rladies.github.io/riverside/2020/05/20/packages.html).

Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us, and to our guest speaker Rebecca Paulette Kurtz-Garcia from Statistics Department, UCR!

See you soon!
