## R Shiny for research and teaching

Hello RiveRside community ;-)

Come join us for a virtual evening of networking and learning on Wednesday, April 22nd at 5pm (PST). This will be our first-ever Zoom meeting! Don't forget to RSVP to get access to the meeting's ID and password.

Whether you are new to R or a data scientist, join us to learn the basics of R Shiny to see how you can build beautiful interactive graphs straight from R!

At the end of the meeting, we will have time to help each other with Shiny or any R-related questions. Please have R and RStudio already installed on your computers. Also please install Shiny and verify that the package is loaded and working properly by running the first three lines of code in the tutorial [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/).

Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us, and to our guest speaker Ana Gomez (@anacrgomez) from UCLA!

See you soon!

Teresa, Marilia & Daniela
