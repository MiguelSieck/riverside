## Analyzing Genomics Data in R with Bioconductor

Hello RiveRside community ;-)

Come join us for a virtual meeting of networking and learning next Wednesday, July 22nd, 12:00 (PST). Don't forget to RSVP in our Meetup to get access to the meeting's ID and password.

Whether you are new to R or a data scientist, join us for an introduction to Bioconductor and tools for analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data.

At the end of the meeting, we will have time to help each other with any R-related questions.

Please have R and RStudio already installed on your computers.

Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us, and to our guest speaker *Dr. Stephanie Hicks* from the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health!

See you soon!
